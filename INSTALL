1. Getting the lot to compile
   --------------------------

To install procmail, lockfile and formail: edit Makefile & config.h accordingly
and type 'make install'.
Intended configurable options in Makefile are:
	the install-destinations
Intended configurable options in config.h are:
	MMDF support, standard environment presettings, trusted userids.

'make install' will:
      - implicitly do a 'make init', which will check your basic utilities for
	POSIX compliance, and generates correcting Makefiles accordingly
      - execute autoconf (a shell script that repeatedly calls the C compiler
	to determine if certain features/symbols are supported), which will
	create a file named autoconf.h
      - create three stripped binaries, a shell script and five man pages in
	the new/ subdirectory (all that is needed to install):
	procmail, lockfile, formail, mailstat, procmail.1, lockfile.1,
	formail.1, procmailrc.5, procmailex.5
      - copy these binaries and mailstat to $(BINDIR)
      - copy the man pages to $(MAN1DIR) and $(MAN5DIR)

'make deinstall' will:
      - remove the just installed files in $(BINDIR)
      - remove the just installed files in $(MAN1DIR) and $(MAN5DIR)


Minimal requirements (for regular uses):

procmail must be installed.

Optional files (depending on your requirements):

lockfile only needs to be installed if you plan to read several mailboxes
	with one of the standard mailers that don't support lockfiles.
formail only needs to be installed if mail sometimes arrives in nonstandard
	mailbox format (or if you want to generate auto replies, split up
	mailboxes/digests etc., see the man page of formail for more info).
mailstat is an "example" shell script that can be used as is to produce
	summaries of the procmail generated logfiles; it is not needed by
	procmail itself in any way.

procmail, lockfile, formail and mailstat are all *standalone* programs, i.e.
they do *not* use any compiled-in paths or files, they all can be used and
installed independently without the need to install the others.

If things don't compile automagically, I suggest you take a look at:
src/autoconf, autoconf.h, config.h, src/includes.h

For autoconf to work as intended, your compiler should either be fully ANSI
compliant, or you should NOT turn off all warnings; enabling all warnings
shouldn't hurt.	 In most cases the default options in the Makefile will do.

The sources are supposed to be fully ANSI, K&R and POSIX compliant.

N.B. If you encounter any difficulty at all in installing procmail (e.g. if you
     had to change Makefile or config.h in unpredicted ways, or a simple
     "make install" doesn't work), I'd very much like to hear about it; who
     knows, next time you might be able to simply "make install" as well.

2. DEBUGGING AID
   -------------

Since procmail is intended to run completely independent of any terminals, it
doesn't use the stderr output to display error messages.  It is recommended,
especially during debugging, to specify a LOGFILE (see man page) in the
rcfile or on the command line.	Procmail will log all serious problems it
encounters.  Of course, instead of a regular file, one could also specify a
terminal as the default logfile.

Also, procmail can be persuaded to be a lot more verbose by inserting the
following assignment at the top of your rcfile:

	VERBOSE=on

Therefore a suggested command line for your first trial run (no rcfiles
needed) would be:

	procmail VERBOSE=on LOGFILE=/dev/tty

(now type in a pseudo mail-message)

If all else fails, you can try uncommenting the "#define console" entry
in the config.h file.  This will provide you with the most verbose procmail
you can make.  It is of course a good idea to comment out this line again
after your troubles have been solved.

If you run procmail by hand and pipe in some sample mail, then make
sure that if you kill procmail, you use "kill pid" and NOT "kill -9 pid".
Should procmail seem to hang, check if the $LOCKFILE is still present.
If you kill procmail with "kill pid" it will clean up the $LOCKFILE
itself.

3. Setting up the environment
   --------------------------

Every user that wants to use procmail should have a .forward and a
.procmailrc file in his HOME directory.	 For starters, you can look
at the supplied example files in "examples".
(BTW, be sure to make .forward *world* readable).
MMDF users should note that they need a .maildelivery file *instead* of the
.forward file (see the procmail(1) man page for more information).

				---

4. Extra options if you are a system administrator
   -----------------------------------------------

If you are a system administrator you can decide to install procmail
globally (i.e. as a more robust drop-in replacement for the local-
maildelivery-capabilities of /bin/mail), this has the advantage that users do
not need to have a .forward file anymore that calls up procmail.  Simply
having a .procmailrc file in the HOME directory will suffice.  Operation is
transparent in this case (i.e. if no .procmailrc file is present in the HOME
directory, mail will be delivered as usual and procmail behaves like a more
reliable /bin/mail substitute).

For direct examples on how to do this, look at the examples/advanced file.

*******************************************************************************
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: install "procmail" suid root (and/or sgid maildaemon)
		    install "lockfile" sgid maildaemon

To obtain specific instructions on the best installation, type "make recommend"
