Please note that the *.man files in this directory still need to be converted
into their *.1 and *.5 counterparts.  You can convert them by typing "make" in
this directory or in the directory above.

The man pages *.1 and *.5 can then be displayed as readable plain text
by typing something like this:

	nroff -man procmail.1

or they can be moved to man directories in your MANPATH to be be viewed with
the normal man command.
