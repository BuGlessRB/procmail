Please note that the *.man files in this directory still need to be converted
into their *.1 and *.5 counterparts.  You can do this by typing "make" in
this directory, or by typing "make" in the directory below.

The man pages *.1 and *.5 can now either be converted to readable plain text
by typing something like:

	nroff -man procmail.1

Or, they can be moved to man directories that are present in your MANPATH
so that the manpages can be viewed using the normal man command.
