The most important system calls that need to be supported (among others):
dup(),wait(),getpwnam(),fork(),pipe()

------------------------------ DESCRIPTION -----------------------------------

The procmail mail processing program. (v2.80 1993/02/04)

Can be used to create mail-servers, mailing lists, sort your incoming mail
into separate folders/files (real convenient when subscribing to one or more
mailing lists or for prioritising your mail), preprocess your mail, start
any programs upon mail arrival (e.g. to generate different chimes on your
workstation for different types of mail) or selectively forward certain
incoming mail automatically to someone.

The accompanying formail program enables you to generate autoreplies, split up
digests/mailboxes into the original messages, do some very simple
header-munging/extraction, or force mail into mail-format (with leading From
line).

----------------------

I made the utmost effort to make procmail as robust as any program can be
(every conceivable system error is caught *and* handled).

Procmail was designed to deliver the mail under the worst conditions
(file system full, out of swap space, process table full, file table full,
missing support files, unavailable executables; it all doesn't matter).
Should (in the unlikely event) procmail be unable to deliver your mail
somewhere, the mail will bounce back to the sender or reenter the mailqueue
(your choice).

For a more extensive list of features see the FEATURES file.

----------------------

However, as with any program, bugs cannot be completely ruled out.
I tested the program extensively, and believe it should be relatively
bug free (no known bug at the time).  Should, however, anyone find any
bugs (highly unlikely :-), I would be pleased (well, sort of :-) to hear
about it.  Please send me the patches or bug report.
I'll look at them and will try to fix it in a future release.
(BTW, if you should find any spelling or grammar errors in these files,
don't hesitate to point them out to me; I like correct English just as much
as you do).

----------------------

I would like to take the opportunity to express my gratitude in particular
to three powerusers of the procmail-package.  Without their constant feedback
v2.80 would not have looked the same:

	David W. Tamkin		An excellent proofreader and betatester
	 <dattier@gagme.chi.il.us>
	Josh Laff		For stresstesting procmail (and me :-)
	 <smiley@uiuc.edu>
	Dan Jacobson		For his many useful suggestions
	 <Dan_Jacobson@ATT.COM>

----------------------

Please note that this program essentially is supposed to be static, that
means no extra features (honouring the VNIX spirit) are supposed to be
added (though any useful suggestions will be appreciated and evaluated if
time permits).

Cheers,
