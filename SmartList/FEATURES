Summary of what the mailinglist scripts in here provide:
	+ The overseeable management of an arbitrary number of mailinglists
	+ Convenient and simple creating of new mailinglists
	+ Convenient and simple removal of existing mailinglists
	+ Fully automated subscription/unsubscription/help-request processing
	  (no operator intervention needed)
	+ Enough intelligence to overcome the stupidity of some subscribers
	  (will direct subscribe and subscribe requests away from the regular
	  list and automatically onto the -request address)
	+ No hardwired format for (un)subscribe requests (i.e. new subscribers
	  need not be educated, unsubscribing users do not need to remember
	  any particular syntax)
	+ Only subscribers to a list can submit messages (the other go to the
	  maintainer of the list, who can then decide)
	+ The fully automated subscription mechanism allows for a reject list
	  of unwanted subscribers
	+ Joint management of several mailinglists possible (through hardlinked
	  rcfiles)
	+ Customisation per mailinglist or mailinglist group possible (simply
	  remove or create the desired hardlinks)
	+ A listmaintainer can be assigned per list;  miscellaneous requests
	  that couldn't be handled by the list automatically are then
	  forwarded to his mail address (instead of being accumulated in
	  a file).
