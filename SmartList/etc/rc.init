#
# IMPORTANT variables to check/change:	PATH domain listmaster
#

# BEFORE editing this file or any rc.* file in the .etc directory
# you should create the .etc/rc.lock file.  As long as this file
# exists, mail delivery to any list will stall (flist checks this file).
#
# Delivery can be temporarily stalled on a per list basis by creating
# the file rc.lock in the respective list's subdirectory.

# ENVIRONMENT:
# list		contains the submitting address of the list (sans domain)
# domain	should contain the domain for the list, so that $list@$domain
#		can be used to submit to the list
# maintainer	should contain the fully qualified address of the maintainer
#		of $list;  maintainter can be left empty
# listmaster	should contain the fully qualified address of the supervising
#		list maintainer;  listmaster can be left empty
# X_ENVELOPE_TO contains the address that the incoming mail was addressed to

# FILES:
# log		optional logfile (uncomment the LOGFILE assignment to enable
#		it)
# dist		the subscriber list, one address per line
# reject	list of people you definitely do want to subscribe
# request	all the messages to request that could not be handled
#		automatically (only if maintainer is empty)
# help.txt	file sent to help requests
# subscribe.txt file sent to new subscribers
# bounces	directory containing the bounce history files
# rc.submit	rcfile used when distributing submissions
# rc.request	rcfile used when processing requests
# rc.custom	rcfile that contains all the customisations per list

# You have to setup the following two assignments, make sure that the address
# mentioned in listmaster is *not* the address this script runs under;	if
# you would end up doing that, then assign listmaster to ""
# The same applies to the maintainer addresses used for every list, if you
# would like to alias them back to this script or to the respective -request
# addresses, then assign maintainer to "" instead.
#
# The mail-domain you have to insert below, must be the fully qualified
# mail-domain for this list;  e.g. if the preferred mail address for this
# account would be:  list@somemachine.somewhere.universe
