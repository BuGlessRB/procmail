#
# IMPORTANT variables to check/change:	PATH domain listmaster
#

# BEFORE editing this file or any rc.* file in the .etc directory
# you should create the .etc/rc.lock file.  As long as this file
# exists, mail delivery to any list will stall (flist checks this file).
#
# Delivery can be temporarily stalled on a per list basis by creating
# the file rc.lock in the respective list's subdirectory.

# ENVIRONMENT:
# list		contains the submitting address of the list (sans domain)
# domain	should contain the domain for the list, so that $list@$domain
#		can be used to submit to the list
# maintainer	should contain the fully qualified address of the maintainer
#		of $list;  maintainter can be left empty
# listmaster	should contain the fully qualified address of the supervising
#		list maintainer;  listmaster can be left empty
# X_ENVELOPE_TO contains the address that the incoming mail was addressed to

# FILES:
# log		optional logfile (uncomment the LOGFILE assignment to enable
#		it)
# dist		the subscriber list, one address per line
# accept	the list of people allowed to submit messages (usually a
#		link to dist, only checked if $foreign_submit != yes)
# accept2	an optional second accept file
# reject	list of people you definitely do not want to subscribe
# subscreen	program (e.g. shell script) to screen prospective subscribers
#		(see in the examples directory for a sample script)
# request	all the messages to request that could not be handled
#		automatically (only if maintainer is empty)
# help.txt	file sent to help & info requests
# info.txt	optional file sent to help & info requests as well,
#		it should contain a concise description of what the
#		list is all about
#		the various info.txt files are optionally gathered in
#		order to advertise the availability of the mailinglists
# subscribe.txt file sent to new subscribers
# subscribe.files file containing an arbitrary number of archive server
#		commands to be executed on behalf of new subscribers
# unsubscribe.txt file sent to unsubscribers
# accept.txt	file sent to people not on the accept list
# archive.txt	file sent to people requesting help from the archive server
# archive	(link to a) directory below which files can be accessed through
#		the archive server
# bounces	directory containing the bounce history files
# rc.submit	rcfile used when distributing submissions
# rc.request	rcfile used when processing requests
# rc.custom	rcfile that contains all the customisations per list
# rc.local.*	optional rcfiles for any local extensions (to be used in
#		conjunction with the RC_LOCAL_* variables which can be set
#		in rc.init or rc.custom files)
