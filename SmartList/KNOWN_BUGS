Address confusion in SmartList (part I)
    While SmartList accepts subscribe and unsubscribe requests that
    specify another address, rc.request checks for the address from the
    headers, not from the request itself.

Address confusion in SmartList (part II)
    When matching addresses, multigram should weight differences
    in the local-part more than differences in the host part.  If
    the local-parts differ, they're almost certainly different
    addresses.

Missing "(Only addresses below this line can be automatically removed)"
    SmartList should provide a clear indication when automatic
    requests are being ignored because this line is missing.  It's
    too subtle a situation as is.
