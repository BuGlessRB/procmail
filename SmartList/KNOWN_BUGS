Address confusion in SmartList
    While SmartList accepts subscribe and unsubscribe requests that
    specify another address, rc.request checks for the address from the
    headers, not from the request itself.  It also appears that
    multigram may have a problem with addresses that don't have a space
    between a double quote and an open angle bracket (unconfirmed).
