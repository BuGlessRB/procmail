	Only the last entry is complete, the others might have been condensed.

1993/02/04: v2.80
	    Started using CVS to manage the source (god's gift to programmers)
1993/02/19: v2.81
1993/06/02: v2.82 (never really released, was only available as prerelease 4)
1993/07/01: v2.90
1993/07/02: v2.91
	    Corrected the SHELL=/bin/shell assignment in install.sh
	    Made install.sh check if procmail was compiled without
	       "#define console"
	    Stripping off leading "From " lines now before passing mails
	       through the mailinglist
1994/06/14: v3.00
	    Cleaned up install.sh* for the mailinglists: starting su with
	       commands on stdin, checking some permissions now in the
	       filesystem to prevent silly mistakes during the installation
	    v2.91 archive server logged into the wrong file (../log), fixed
	    Made the x_command script list the nearest match when adding
	       or removing people from a list
	    New x_command directive: checkdist
	    New convenience command: donatelist
	    Fixed a few typos that slipped into procbounce and flush_digests
	    Explicit support for moderated lists
	    Eliminating duplicate submissions
	    Catering for autoreplies to people not on the accept list
	    Flush_digests can now be forced to push out digests
	    Made the generated digests MIME compliant
	    Clipped an a bit too greedy -request-redirection-regexp in
	       rc.submit
	    Implicit subscription can be enabled (force_subscribe in
	       rc.custom)
	    You can create a subscreen script to screen the addresses
	       of prospective subscribers (allows tighter control)
	    Tuned the procbounce script (it does what I mean now
	       and it got more verbose in its diagnostics)
	    Taught procbounce about the more information deprived
	       bounce messages (it can handle almost every bounce now)
	    Changes to the arch_retrieve script:
	       - allow the archive directory to be a symbolic link itself
	       - friendlier help command
	       - allow searching for regexps
	       - protect the user against all too eager wildcards
	       - fixed the ls command (one mail back per command)
	       - made it more intelligent with respect to ignoring
		 signatures
	       - the standalone archive server will include the contents
		 of the optional help.txt and info.txt files on a help
		 request
	       - raise the breakoff_search limit
	       - allow the most common flags on egrep
	    Carbon copies of subscription requests contained misleading
	       diagnostics
	    Subscription notifications will be done to both the sender
	       and the new subscriber (in case the addresses differ)
	    Fixed the problem of sometimes subscribing "please"
	    Educated subscribe about some caveats when extracting the
	       subscription addresses from the signatures
	    Provided for standard hooks where people can plug in their
	       semi-permanent local customisations in the rcfiles
	    Split off the mailinglist scripts in a separate package called
	       "SmartList"
	    Flist recognises itself as flist if argv[0] starts with `flist'
	    Install.sh now tries to preset rc.init.new with values for
	       PATH, domain and listmaster (if you are upgrading)
	    Rc.submit will add a To: field to outgoing mails if there wasn't
	       any
	    Mail to digested lists will be automatically reposted on the
	       undigested list (if any)
	    Provided for an alt_sendmail variable in rc.init, to switch
	       between the two sendmail invocations
	    Adding the X-Diagnostic: Unprocessed if no further processing
	       seems to have taken place
	    Moved the idcheck functionality into formail -D (due to
	       popular demand)
	    Use the setid program instead of su while installing (does away
	       with those "inexplicable" installation problems)
	    Weed out duplicate Date: fields before resending mails
	    Created choplist, the dist-file expander
	    Created cronlist, the new recommended script to put in the
	       crontab entry (instead of flush_digests directly)
	    Allow for carbon copies to the maintainer of unsubscription
	       requests
	    Documented and slightly changed the behaviour of the digest.admin
	       administrivia files
	    If possible, the lists are now installed relative to the home
	       directory of the `list' account
	    Install the examples directory to .examples
	    Fixed the automatic archive history truncation for digests, they
	       previously were not truncated at all
	    Flist -v displays information about the currently installed version
	       of SmartList
	    Extracted the hardcoded help from the archive server into the
	       archive.txt file
	    Changed procbounce to send a final unsubscription message to
	       people that were taken off the list due to too many bounces
	    Allow reply_to to override the Reply-To: field in the digest
	    Support for default help text responses
	    Allow for unsubscription assistance
	    Full blown MIME support for the archive server (binary files,
	       arbitrary length, autosplitting, full MIME-encapsulation)
	    The archive server understands the "version" command
1994/06/15: v3.01
	    v3.00 didn't react to plain (un)subscribe requests
	    Installation as non-root had problems finding the right directory
1994/06/16: v3.02
	    Modifications to the archive server:
	       - support the MIME dir="" and name="" parameters
	       - force it to sleep between sending files (lowers load)
	       - only queue sent files, then flush the queue (lowers load)
	    Modifications to multigram:
	       - Strip leading or trailing unbalanced "'s from mailaddresses
	    The installation makes the scripts in .examples executable
	    This version of flist -v erroneously displayed v3.01
1994/06/21: v3.03
	    Laid out the requirements for MIME support in the Manual
	    Modifications to the archive server:
	      - fix a typo in mimencap for the fallback Content-Type: field
	      - also support the planned Content-Disposition: field (for naming
		files)
	    Updated some misleading comments in rc.submit
