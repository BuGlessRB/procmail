This archive server knows the following commands:

get filename ...
ls directory ...
egrep case_insensitive_regular_expression filename ...
maxfiles nnn
version
quit

Aliases for 'get': send, sendme, getme, gimme, retrieve, mail
Aliases for 'ls': dir, directory, list, show
Aliases for 'egrep': search, grep, fgrep, find
Aliases for 'quit': exit

Lines starting with a '#' are ignored.
Multiple commands per mail are allowed.
Setting maxfiles to zero will remove the limit (to protect you against
yourself no more than maxfiles files will be returned per request).
Egrep supports most common flags.
If you append a non-standard signature, you should use the quit command
to prevent the archive server from interpreting the signature.

Examples:
ls latest
get latest/12
egrep some.word latest/*
