General info:

Subcription/unsubscription/info requests should always be sent to the -request
address of a mailinglist.
If a mailinglist for example is called "thelist@some.domain", then the -request
address can be inferred from this to be: "thelist-request@some.domain".

To subscribe to a mailinglist, simply send a message with the word "subscribe"
in the Subject: field to the -request address of that list.

To unsubscribe from a mailinglist, simply send a message with the word (you
guessed it :-) "unsubscribe" in the Subject: field to the -request address of
that list.

With the subscription request you can optionally specify that you do
not want to receive back any copies of your own submissions.  You can
do this by adding the following text in your subscription request:
	"no copies please."
This feature is not fully supported yet.  You will be marked as such, but
you will receive back copies anyway.

In the event of an address change, it would probably be the wisest to first
send an unsubscribe for the old address (this can be done from the new
address), and then a new subscribe to the new address (the order is important).

Most (un)subscription requests are processed automatically without human
intervention.
