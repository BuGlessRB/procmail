Subject: Welcome to your new list: $listaddr

Welcome to your new list, $listaddr, of which you are the owner.
As the owner, you are responsible for its maintenance, which is
a fairly simple process given that it is being managed by SmartList.

The procedure for remote list management is:

a. send an e-mail to the address: $list-request@$domain
b. place administrative commands on the header: "X-Command:",
   using the syntax:

   X-Command: $owner PASSWORD COMMAND

   where for your list, $list, the password is: "$passwd".

   Command is one of:

   subscribe MAILADDRESS	- add MAILADDRESS to the dist list
   unsubscribe MAILADDRESS	- remove MAILADDRESS from the dist list
   checkdist MAILADDRESS	- see if MAILADDRESS is on the dist list

   showdist		- show the current dist list
   showlist		- show details of the list configuration
   showlog		- show the log of subs, unsubs, and archive requests
   wipelog		- clear the log
   help			- send help
   info			- same as help

If you ever need further assistance in managing your list, you can
contact the list master at $listmaster.

If you are not the owner of this list, please respond to this mail
with an explanation, provide the new owner address, or ask to
have the list removed.
