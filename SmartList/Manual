1. Creating and removing mailinglists
   ----------------------------------

Make sure that the .bin directory is in your PATH.  Now you can issue
commands like:

	createlist testing
	createlist testing joe@somewhere.edu
	removelist testing

The first command creates a mailinglist with two useful addresses:

	testing
	testing-request

The second command does the same, but it also specifies joe@somewhere.edu
to be the responsible contact person for this list.

The third command removes all traces of the "testing" mailinglist again.

There is one other convenience-utility that can be used: "delink"
It will unlink a file from its hardlinked counterpart(s).


2. Remote maintenance of mailinglists
   ----------------------------------

To facilitate remote maintenance of some mailinglists by their maintainers
I have created the .bin/x_command script.  It parses mails sent to the
-request address and can execute some administrative commands.

The mail should be sent to the -request address of a mailinglist and
should contain a field in the header looking like this:

X-Command: joe@somewhere.edu password command

"command" can be anything of the following:

	subscribe mailaddress
	unsubscribe mailaddress
	showdist			To list the distfile
	showlog				To list the log
	wipelog				To clear the log
	help				To show this command summary
	info				Ditto

The exact fieldname defaults to "X-Command", but can be customised to
whatever you want.

The password defaults to "password", but can/should be changed.

The "joe@somewhere.edu" is always the mail address of the maintainer.  Note
that this has to match what was specified on the command line of
"createlist" when the list was created.

Note that the X-Command: field has to be part of the header, when it's
in the body of the mail, it has no effect.

Anytime an X-Command: mail has been processed, the results will be
mailed back to the maintainer of the list, and the X-Command: field
will have been renamed to X-Processed:.

Although this remote-facility is convenient, some might argue that it
presents a security hole.  Well, in order to make this hole as small as
possible, you can keep the password secret.  Also, the exact mailaddress
of the maintainer might not be publicly known.	You can simply change
the X-Command field into something else like X-MyCommand.  Above all, since
faking mail is a well known possibility it would be ridiculous to take
more precautions than these.


3. Customisation
   -------------

The mailinglists can be customised in several ways:

- For all the lists:
	- Since all the lists share the same help.txt, subscibe.txt, rc.init,
	  rc.submit and rc.request files (hardlinked), any change to them
	  will affect all lists.
	- Since all the lists have the .bin directory in their PATH, any
	  change to one of the Bourne shell scripts in there will affect
	  them all.
- Per list:
	- Every list directory contains an "rc.custom" rcfile which can
	  be edited to your hearts content to customise certain parameters
	  for this list only.
	- For graver customisation you can remove the hardlink (using
	  .bin/delink for example) to any of the files in a list directory and
	  provide that list with its own copy in order to edit that to taste.
	- Since the current directory is in the PATH before the .bin
	  directory you can create per-list copies of any of the Bourne shell
	  scripts in .bin which can then be changed without affecting the
	  other lists.
- Per group of lists:
	- The same applies as when customising per list, but you should
	  then hardlink the appropriate files among the group of list
	  directories.

If you are not using the remote-maintenance facility and you start editing
or customising scripts/files by hand, then you should make sure that there
doesn't arrive any mail to those lists that are affected by your changes.

If you are editing while the system is running you can temporarily put
incoming mails on hold;	 you can do this:

- for all the lists by creating the file:	.etc/rc.lock
- only for one list by creating the file:	rc.lock
  in the list directory of that list.

The .bin/flist command checks to see if these rc.lock files exist AND are
not older than 17 minutes before delivering the mail.  So, if you create
an rc.lock file, mails to that (or all) lists will stall for the next
17 minutes.  If you need more time, touch the file every so often.
You should remove the rc.lock files again after finishing your editing.


4. The archive server
   ------------------

All mail (except mail being forwarded from another mailinglist) sent to any
of the lists is archived.  The archiving is fairly straightforward.
E.g. if you have a list called "scuba", then all submissions are archived
in scuba/archive/latest/.  The mails will be stored one-mail-per-file each.
The files will be numbered.

Now, normally, only the last two mails will be kept around, the others
are periodically removed.  This in order to keep down the archiving costs
for people with limited diskspace.  To disable archiving completely,
edit the rc.submit file.  To simply make the archive-history longer,
edit the rc.custom file.  To get more sophisticated archiving, like grouping
submissions monthly, you should either create a cron job or edit the
.bin/arch_trunc file.

The archive server can be accessed per mailinglist by sending mail
to the -request address with the following Subject:

	Subject: archive

The body of the mail or the rest of the subject line can then be
filed with requests to the archive server.  It basically understands
three commands:

	get file ...
	ls directory ...
	help

The archive server does a thorough check on the commands and the files
that are requested.  This to ensure that it does not access any files
outside the "scuba/archive" directory.	Any text-file that you put below
the "scuba/archive" directory can now be retrieved by the archive commands.

The whole archive server can be found in the .bin/arch_retrieve script.


5. The format of the dist file
   ---------------------------

You do not need to know this, unless you edit the dist file by hand or want
to incorporate an existing list of addresses.

In order to distribute incoming submissions the dist file is fed to sendmail
with the regular :include: alias.  So the format of this file must
be in accordance with what sendmail would expect.  In addition to that
this file is searched and edited by multigram in order to find particular
subscribers.  The format which multigram expects is a bit more rigid than
what sendmail allows.

The following conditions apply:
- One subscriber per line.
- Empty lines are allowed.
- The mail address of the subscriber must be the first word on the line.
- Comments may follow the address (but separated from the address by
  at least one whitespace character).
- Everything preceding the line containing:
	(Only addresses below this line can be automatically removed)
  is write protected from changes by multigram (i.e. these addresses can
  never be automatically/accidentally unsubscribed).
- If the line:
	(Only addresses below this line can be automatically removed)
  is not present at all, automatic unsubscriptions to this list are impossible.
- Whenever multigram automatically removes an address from the list, it
  rewrites the dist file `in situ'.  This means that the dist file will be
  contracted at that point, any excess slack at the end will be overwritten
  by newlines (i.e. the dist file never shrinks, this because ANSI-C does not
  provide a truncate() command of some kind).  I choose to write in situ in
  order to avoid copying the dist file every time it changes (a real life
  saver if the list grows too big).
- Multigram always adds new subscribers on the line immediately following the
  last filled entry in the dist file.

Some sample entries (the preferred format):
	joe@some.where
	joe@some.where (some comment)
	joe@some.where (some comment) (some more comment)

Depreciated, but allowed:
	<joe@some.where>
	<joe@some.where> some comment
	<joe@some.where> (some comment)

Not allowed by multigram (although sendmail doesn't mind):
	(some comment) joe@some.where
	some comment <joe@some.where>
