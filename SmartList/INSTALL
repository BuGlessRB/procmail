Before you start installing mailinglists there are some things you should
consider:

- In order to make sure that the mailinglist scripts work reliably for both
remote and local mail, they have to be run under someone's account.
The recommended procedure would be to create a new account and group named
"list" that is only going to be used to manage the mailinglist stuff.

- If you are unable/unwilling to create a new user just for the mailinglist
stuff, then the mailinglist scripts should be installed in a separate
subdirectory.  You then have to edit the .listadmin/listrc.main file to
make sure that mail arriving for this person first gets checked to see if
it was for one of the mailinglists, and if it wasn't, that only then
the regular procmailrc processing takes place.

- In the mailinglist scripts I made use of the -f option of sendmail.  This
option makes sure that the sender address on the envelope (the From_ line)
contains the proper list address.  In order for this option to work, the
user using it (either "list" or the regular user the lists run under) must
be on the trusted-user-list of sendmail.  To enter the user "list" on the
trusted-user-list simply edit the sendmail.cf file and add a line reading:

Tlist

Restarting sendmail is not necessary.


Now, back to installing the mailinglist scripts:

Suppose you have create this pseudo user "list" and its home directory would
be /home/list
Simply execute the "install.sh" script present in this directory by typing
something like:

	sh install.sh /home/list

This script will then create two subdirectories (.bin and .listadmin) in
/home/list.  These directories will be filled with the files contained
in the bin and listadmin subdirectories here.  It will also make sure that
the "multigram" program is compiled from the procmail/src directory and
copied into /home/list/.bin.  Furthermore it will link
/home/list/.listadmin/listrc.main to /home/list/.procmailrc.

Depending on your mail configuration, if procmail has not been integrated
in the maildelivery system (see procmail/examples/advanced for more information
on that topic) you also have to create a .forward file with an appropriate
content (see "man procmail", the NOTES section at the end).

	Next, edit the /home/list/.listadmin/listrc.main file.	Make sure that
	"domain" is set to the right value, and you can optionally specify a
	"listmaster".

After this, you are all set.  Log in as (or su to) the "list" user and make
sure that /home/list/.bin is in your path.  Then type something like:

	createlist testing

You will then have just created a mailinglist with two useful addresses:

	testing and testing-request

To remove this list again, type something like:

	removelist testing

Also try using the createlist program without arguments to see the optional
extra argument.
