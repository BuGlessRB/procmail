Before you start installing mailinglists there are some things you should
consider:

- In order to make sure that the mailinglist scripts work reliably for both
remote and local mail, they have to be run under someone's account.
The recommended procedure would be to create a new account and group named
"list" that is only going to be used to manage the mailinglist stuff.

- If you are unable/unwilling to create a new user just for the mailinglist
stuff, then the mailinglist scripts should be installed in a separate
subdirectory.  This user will still be able to receive regular mail.

- In the mailinglist scripts I made use of the -f option of sendmail.  This
option makes sure that the sender address on the envelope (the From_ line)
contains the proper list address.  In order for this option to work, the
user using it (either "list" or the regular user the lists run under) must
be on the trusted-user-list of sendmail.  To enter the user "list" on the
trusted-user-list simply edit the sendmail.cf file and add a line reading:

Tlist

Restarting sendmail is not necessary.


Now, back to installing the mailinglist scripts:

Suppose you have created this pseudo user "list" and its home directory would
be /home/list
Simply execute the "install.sh" script (preferably as user "list") present in
this directory by typing something like:

	sh install.sh /home/list

This script will then create two subdirectories (.bin and .etc) in
/home/list.  These directories will be filled with the files contained
in the bin and etc subdirectories here.	 It will also make sure that
the "multigram" program is compiled from the procmail*/src directory and
copied into /home/list/.bin.  Furthermore it will link
/home/list/.etc/rc.main to /home/list/.procmailrc.  The latter is of
course superfluous if you are still using this account to receive
regular mail.

Depending on your mail configuration, if procmail has not been integrated
in the maildelivery system (see procmail*/examples/advanced for more
information on that topic) you also have to create a .forward file with an
appropriate content (see "man procmail", the NOTES section at the end).	 This,
however, is only necessary if you created a seperate "list" account.

	Next, edit the /home/list/.etc/rc.init file.	Make sure that
	"domain" is set to the right value, and you can optionally specify a
	"listmaster";  also check if the PATH is correct and make sure
	that the procmail and formail are in the path.

For further instructions, you should read the "Manual" file, it has
been copied to the /home/list/.etc directory as well, and can serve as a
quick reference.
