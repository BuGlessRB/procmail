1. Prerequisites
   -------------

In order to make sure that the mailinglist scripts work reliably for both
remote and local mail, they have to be run under someone's account.
The recommended procedure would be to create a new account and group named
"list" that is only going to be used to manage the mailinglist stuff.

If you are unable/unwilling to create a new user just for the mailinglist
stuff, then the mailinglist scripts should be installed in a separate
subdirectory.  This user will still be able to receive regular mail.

In the mailinglist scripts I made use of the -f option of sendmail.  This
option makes sure that the sender address on the envelope (the From_ line)
contains the proper list address.  In order for this option to work, the
user using it (either "list" or the regular user the lists run under) must
be on the trusted-user-list of sendmail.  To enter the user "list" on the
trusted-user-list simply edit the sendmail.cf file and add a line reading:

Tlist

Restarting sendmail is not necessary.

2. Installing the scripts
   ----------------------

Suppose you have created this pseudo user "list" with a specified home
directory of /home/list

Now create /home/list by hand and make sure that you chown it to "list".

Next, make sure that you are running as root (su root) and execute the
"install.sh" script present in this directory by typing something like:

	sh install.sh /home/list

This script will then create two subdirectories (.bin and .etc) in
/home/list.  These directories will be filled with the files contained
in the bin and etc subdirectories here.	 It will also make sure that
the "multigram" program is compiled from the procmail*/src directory and
copied into /home/list/.bin.

Furthermore install.sh will link /home/list/.etc/rc.main to
/home/list/.procmailrc.	 This is of course superfluous (but nondestructive) if
you are still using this account to receive regular mail.

Depending on your mail configuration, if procmail has not been integrated
in the maildelivery system (see procmail*/examples/advanced for more
information on that topic) you also have to create a .forward file with an
appropriate content (see "man procmail", the NOTES section at the end).	 This,
however, is only necessary if you created a seperate "list" account.

	Next, edit the /home/list/.etc/rc.init file.	Make sure that
	"domain" is set to the right value, and you can optionally specify a
	"listmaster";  also check if the PATH is correct and make sure
	that the procmail and formail are in the path.

For further instructions, you should read the "Manual" file, it has
been copied to the /home/list/.etc directory as well, and can serve as a
quick reference.

3. Sharing the scripts on multiple architectures
   ---------------------------------------------

For people that want to run the lists on a shared filesystem across different
architectures there exists the possibility of using several .bin directories.
Simply use something like:
	sh install.sh /home/list .bin.sun4
to install to a different .bin directory.  Repeat the complete procmail and
mailinglist installation for every architecture, specifying a different .bin
directory every time.

				---

4. If you don't have a sendmail compatible mailer
   ----------------------------------------------

As is, these scripts are preconfigured to use sendmail (or a compatible
mailer like smail) to actually transport the mails.  If your system only
supplies a /bin/rmail or /bin/mail to transport mails, then several of
the options used when invoking sendmail will not work.

For these cases you have to edit the /home/list/.etc/rc.init file.
Look for a SENDMAIL assignment.	 Supplied with these scripts is a poor man's
sendmail.  It was installed in the .bin directory belonging to the
list.  Make sure that the SENDMAIL assignment points at the sendmails script.
And, of course, don't forget to uncomment the SENDMAIL assignment and
the two sendmailOPT* assigments following it.

5. Upgrading from previous versions of these scripts
   -------------------------------------------------

Before you start the upgrade, create the file /home/list/.etc/rc.lock
Now do a ps and see if any procmail-list instances are currently
running.  Wait till they are gone.  Now touch the rc.lock file once more.
You know have 17 minutes to complete the upgrade.  If it should take
longer, touch the rc.lock file every so often.	As soon as the difference
between its mtime and the current time exceeds 17 minutes, the flist
programs start delivering mail to the lists again.

You can simply use the install.sh script again to install directly over
the old installation IF you customised ONLY the master rc.init and rc.custom
files.	Once you ran the install.sh script, you'll have to merge the changes
you made to the old rc.init file (still there) into the rc.init.new file.
Then cat (yes, use `cat', because you have to preserve the hardlinks) the
rc.init.new file into the rc.init file.
There are some new entries in the new rc.custom file template.	Since they
are commented out (i.e. rc.init already provides defaults) their omission
in the old rc.custom files should not cause any problems.

If you customised more than just the rc.init or rc.custom files, you'll
have to make diffs between the old versions of the scripts, then install
the new scripts and then apply back the diffs (probably by hand).
The reason why parts of the old scripts cannot operate with the new scripts
is because they expect several new environment variables to be set (like
digest selection or not).  The new rc.init sets them of course.

You can quickly verify which files are linked to other files by
simply typing something like:

	showlink rc.init

After you are finished, remove the rc.lock file again.	If it is older
than 17 minutes it is ignored anyway, but it's cleaner this way.
