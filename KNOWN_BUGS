TIMEOUT doesn't always work
    If a shell is invoked then procmail may wait while executing a
    command for longer than TIMEOUT specifies.

Variable capture actions overwrite before executing
    Variable capture actions clear the value of the variable being
    captured before the action is executed, thus causing the following
    action, for example, to not work as desired:
	variable=|echo "$variable" | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'

regexp matching bug
    Some regexps may return an incorrect value in the MATCH variable.
    In particular when 'redundant' * or + operators appear on the left-
    hand side of the \/ token or 'tenative' matches overlap with the real
    match.

`formail -R "Resent-" ""' doesn't work

SmartList digest directories are mod 100
    Starting in the year 2000 they should go to being the full year.

Incorrect usage of -lnsl and -lsocket
    libsocket and libnsl should be avoided if not needed as they're
    broken under at least one version of IRIX

Address confusion in SmartList
    While SmartList accepts subscribe and unsubscribe requests that
    specify another address, rc.request checks for the address from the
    headers, not from the request itself.  It also appears that
    multigram may have a problem with addresses that don't have a space
    between a double quote and an open angle bracket (unconfirmed).

Variable expansion corners
    For the underbar variable and numeric variables, putting the name
    of the variable in braces causes the internal meaning to be
    ignored.
