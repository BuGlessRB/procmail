1991/10/02: v2.20 (never released)
1991/10/18: v2.30
	    Implemented a custom regular expression library (fully egrep
	       compatible), should eliminate the annoyances with incompatible
	       egreps
	    Reached the doubtful milestone of having a source file (regexp.c)
	       which provokes a compiler error on an old compiler
	       (if using the optimiser)
1991/10/22: v2.31
1991/12/05: v2.40
	    Made procmail capable of healing the recipient's mail spool file
	    Tricked NFS into supplying an access_time<modification_time for the
	       folders written
1991/12/13: v2.50
1992/01/22: v2.60
1992/01/31: v2.61
1992/04/30: v2.70
	    Made procmail & lockfile clock skew independent (important during
	       LOCKTIMEOUT)
	    Made special entries in config.h for semi-permanent environment-
	       variable overrides
1992/07/01: v2.71
	    Now throwing away all environment variables starting with LD_
	       (not just LD_LIBRARY_PATH), but only on those machines that
	       have the security hole (i.e. SunOS)
	    Gave procmail, formail, lockfile and mailstat a more verbose
	       command line help (called up by -h or -?)
1993/02/04: v2.80
	    Started using CVS to manage the source (god's gift to programmers)
	    Substantially changed the examples/advanced mailer integration
	       instructions (especially for smail)
	    Enhanced lockfile a lot:
	       - the -r option really specifies *re*tries now
	       - concatenated and/or seperate options are allowed now
	       - fixed an inconsistency with removing lockfiles by force
	       - lockfile is more intelligent about locks which are impossible
		 to acquire (it sees it now and displays an appropriate error
		 message)
	       - related to this, lockfile now can return a whole range of
		 standard exitcodes to describe the error
	       - dropped the suid support for lockfile, sgid support however
		 was consolidated (with more descriptive error messages)
	    Changes to formail:
	       - formail does *NOT* CONCATENATE continued header-fields by
		 default now anymore, specify the -c option for this
	       - fixed the sender-determination-code, v2.71 didn't comply
		 with RFC-822 on some points
	       - the sender-determination-code now minimises the mailaddress
	       - taught formail about some more headers, previously formail
		 would refuse to split some mail-articles because it didn't
		 recognise the second field
	       - made it strip the <> on generated mail addresses
	       - reorganised the known header-fields into the header.h file
		 (to allow convenient additions)
	       - introduced the -l option, for generating procmail-alike
		 summaries
	       - introduced the -R option for renaming header-fields
	       - taught it about the Resent- fields when looking for a reply
		 address
	       - made sure that it does not generate an extra empty line at
		 the end of a mail with no body
	       - fixed the '-nnn' option, somehow this got broken
	       - added the -X option for extracting complete fields (to make
		 the toolset complete)
	       - defined away one const, for buggy Convex "ANSI" C compilers
	    Changes to procmail:
	       - procmail does *NOT* CONCATENATE continued header-fields
		 anymore, filter through "formail -c" for this
	       - procmail only escapes bogus From_ lines now when writing a
		 regular mailfolder (otherwise it's unchanged)
	       - changed the method for turning on extended diagnostics, the
		 preceding colon is not supported anymore, use VERBOSE=on
	       - worked over the mailbox-healing code, some changes were
		 needed to ensure complete functionality when the system
		 mailbox is in the user's home directory
	       - taught procmail about $? (see sh(1))
	       - added the INCLUDERC keyword, to permit unlimited nesting
		 of included rcfiles
	       - any program started in backquotes by procmail now has the
		 complete mail on its stdin
	       - all diagnostics logged by procmail will now be preceded by
		 a "procmail: " for easy identification
	       - as long as no LOGFILE has been specified, all diagnostics
		 will be mailed back to the sender (instead of /dev/null)
	       - when a program is specified on an action line, you can
		 precede the line by an environment variable name and an
		 equal sign;  this will read in the (unlimited length) text
		 from stdout into this variable
	       - backslash-newline pairs on continued program-action lines
		 will be simply passed on now;	unless the backslash-newline
		 pair is on an otherwise empty line, in which case only the
		 newline remains
	       - comsat/biff is fully supported now
	       - added the TRAP keyword, to allow for temporary file cleanup
	       - in explicit delivery mode, unknown users are now rejected
	       - system mailboxes with their suid or sgid bits set will not
		 be delivered to anymore, they are presumed to contain SysV
		 autoforwarding information
	       - a condition line of a recipe can now start with '?' in order
		 to use the exitcode of a program as true or false
	       - the ^TO and ^FROM_DAEMON special keywords can now be used
		 anywhere in the regular expression (^TO has been extended
		 as well)
	       - taught the ^^ special token to the internal egrep
	       - more than doubled the speed of the builtin regexp library
		 (which was already fast :-)
	       - procmail uses and defines LOGNAME instead of USER
	    Changes to the installation scripts:
	       - preset values for $(MAKE), $(CC) and $(SHELL) are respected
		 in Makefiles now
	       - a POSIX conforming grep is recognised and used
	       - the need for any -D_POSIX_SOURCE is recognised automatically
	       - to make sure that all this is possible, the Makefiles are
		 created in a two step-process now (make init)
	       - missing libraries for network/socket and opendir support
		 are searched for (you won't believe what names people picked
		 for network support libraries, not in your wildest dreams :-)
	       - the autoconf script now performs a reliability test on kernel
		 locking support
	       - also, network support for comsat tries to build up a compile
		 time cache for trivial get*byname() calls
	       - reached the doubtful milestone of consistently crashing the
		 kernel on a Convex by running the locktst program
1993/02/19: v2.81
	    Fixed a major inconvenience when generating the Makefiles in
	       initmake
	    Loosened the formats accepted for (un)subscription requests (some
	       got rejected, but were valid)
	    Redirected archive requests away from the regular list address
	    Sharpened the FROM_MAIL_DAEMON detection
	    Flist, idhash and multigram now use the correct name on error
	       reports
	    Sped up multigram on duplicate names (also eliminates duplicates
	       in the best-matches list)
	    The locking tests in the autoconf scripts seemed to hang on
	       certain machines, I think I fixed that now
	    Procmail now uses saved-gids if available (allows for system-
	       mailbox locking from within an rcfile on systems that did not
	       have world-writeable /usr/mail directories)
	    Procmail ignores locallockfiles if the file that has to be locked
	       turns out to be /dev/null
	    Added a paragraph to the mailinglist/Manual (explaining multigram
	       and threshold values)
1993/06/02: v2.82 (never really released, was only available as prerelease 4)
	    Fixed sleeptime argument to lockfile
	    Refined the ^FROM_DAEMON macro again
	    Added a ^FROM_MAILER macro
	    Fixed the library conflict with openlog
	    Removed the dependencies on the structure of /usr/include
	    Removed the dependencies on the structure of /lib, /usr/lib etc.
	    Enhanced autoconf to ask for LOCKINGTEST directories
	    Added an extra paragraph to INSTALL explaining the necessity of
	       the LOCKINGTESTs
	    Made the internal egrep in procmail warn about mismatching parens
	       in a regexp
	    Made the regexp lib faster again (worst case performance improved)
	    Split up the manpage auto-generated sed scripts, some seds cannot
	       process scripts with more than 100 commands
	    Changed manpage substitions tokens to use @*@ instead of +*+
	    Added example recipe for emacs users in the procmailex man page
	    Extended recommend.c, it advises changing the permissions on
	       the system mail spool directory as well now (if needed)
	    Procmail can now deliver to multiple directories (using hardlinks)
	    If the umask permits o+x, this bit will be set on any mailbox
	       procmail delivers to directly
	    Added the LASTFOLDER & LOGABSTRACT variables to procmail in order
	       to ease the generation of custom logfile abstracts/summaries
	    Programs started from within TRAP can read the mail from stdin
	    Worked my way around the !@#$%^&*() POSIX setgid() semantics (if
	       your OS supports setrgid() or setregid())
	    Using off_t now (I seem to have overlooked it in my POSIX docs)
	    Eliminated all uses of "expr match"
	    Altered mailstat to work on really broken shells
	    Extended the FAQ
	    Changes to the mailinglist scripts:
	       - Finetuned some scripts
	       - Added digested lists
	       - Added standalone archive servers
	       - Extended logging for administrivia requests
	       - Flist can and should be setuid root now, POSIX setuid
		 semantics require it <sigh>
	       - Added support for multiple architectures
	       - Updated and extended the Manual file (reading recommended)
	       - Added the showlink convenience utility
	       - Added support for non-sendmail compatible mailers
1993/07/01: v2.90
	    Condition lines in recipes can now be started with a leading `*',
	       there is no longer a need to count condition lines, simply
	       set the number to zero, and let procmail find out by itself
	    Added the -a and -m options to procmail, for enhanced interfacing
	       to sendmail
	    Updated the recommended sendmail.cf mailer entry docs in
	       examples/advanced
	    Fixed a race condition when the recipient mailbox did not exist
	       and two procmails simultaneously tried to create it
	    Cleaned up main() in procmail.c (localised variables)
	    Made sure the logfile was flushed before procmail exits
	    When procmail gobbles up the leading From_ line, it reads in 2KB
	       blocks now (instead of character wise; saves a few system calls)
