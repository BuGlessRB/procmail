1991/07/12: v2.11
1991/10/02: v2.20 (never released)
1991/10/18: v2.30
	    Reached the doubtful milestone of having a source file (regexp.c)
	       which provokes a compiler error on an old compiler
	       (if using the optimiser)
1991/10/22: v2.31
1991/12/05: v2.40
1991/12/13: v2.50
1992/01/22: v2.60
1992/01/31: v2.61
1992/04/30: v2.70
1992/07/01: v2.71
	    Gave procmail, formail, lockfile and mailstat a more verbose
	       command line help (called up by -h or -?)
1993/02/04: v2.80
	    Started using CVS to manage the source (god's gift to programmers)
	    Changes to formail:
	       - formail does *NOT* CONCATENATE continued header-fields by
		 default now anymore, specify the -c option for this
	       - fixed the sender-determination-code, v2.71 didn't comply
		 with RFC-822 on some points
	    Changes to procmail:
	       - procmail does *NOT* CONCATENATE continued header-fields
		 anymore, filter through "formail -c" for this
	       - procmail only escapes bogus From_ lines now when writing a
		 regular mailfolder (otherwise it's unchanged)
	       - changed the method for turning on extended diagnostics, the
		 preceding colon is not supported anymore, use VERBOSE=on
	       - comsat/biff is fully supported now
	    Changes to the installation scripts:
	       - the autoconf script now performs a reliability test on kernel
		 locking support
	       - reached the doubtful milestone of consistently crashing the
		 kernel on a Convex by running the locktst program
1993/02/19: v2.81
	    Procmail now uses saved-gids if available (allows for system-
	       mailbox locking from within an rcfile on systems that did not
	       have world-writable /usr/mail directories)
1993/06/02: v2.82 (never really released, was only available as prerelease 4)
	    Made the regexp lib faster again (worst case performance improved)
	    Procmail can now deliver to multiple directories (using hardlinks)
	    If the umask permits o+x, this bit will be set on any mailbox
	       procmail delivers to directly
	    Worked my way around the !@#$%^&*() POSIX setgid() semantics (if
	       your OS supports setrgid() or setregid())
1993/07/01: v2.90
	    Condition lines in recipes can now be started with a leading `*',
	       there is no longer a need to count condition lines, simply
	       set the number to zero, and let procmail find out by itself
	    Added the -a and -m options to procmail, for enhanced interfacing
	       to sendmail
	    Updated the recommended sendmail.cf mailer entry docs in
	       examples/advanced
	    Fixed a race condition when the recipient mailbox did not exist
	       and two procmails simultaneously tried to create it
	    Cleaned up main() in procmail.c (localised variables)
	    When procmail gobbles up the leading From_ line, it reads in 2KB
	       blocks now (instead of character wise; saves a few system calls)
1993/07/02: v2.91
	    Fixed a race condition in autoconf that caused problems on machines
	       that didn't have memmove(3) and were too fast (make got confused
	       about the modification time of an object file)
	    Fixed a typo in the regex library (introduced in v2.82pre4),
	       caused some valid matches not to be found if the regular
	       expression starts with an epsilon transition
	    Fixed a few typos in the man pages
	    Made sure the logfile was flushed before procmail exits
	    Forgot to redirect output of a test in autoconf to /dev/null
	    Reached the doubtful milestone to sometimes crash an Ultrix
	       machine (due to the lockingtests, not procmail itself)
1994/06/14: v3.00
	    Changes to procmail:
	       - Changed the semantics of the TRAP keyword.  In order to
		 make procmail accept the exitcode it returns, you now have
		 to set EXITCODE=""
	       - It was still occasionally trying to lock /dev/null, which
		 is of course silly, fixed that
	       - Taught it about `nesting recipes'; they allow parts of
		 an rcfile to be grouped hierarchically
	       - Fixed a discrepancy with /bin/sh backquote expansion in
		 environment assignments (preserving all spaces)
	       - Logs its pid and a timestamp when VERBOSE=on
	       - Caused the regular TIMEOUT to break a `hanging' kernel lock
	       - SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 can be used to turn on and off verbose
		 logging
	       - Worked around a bug in the `ANSI'-compiler of Domain/OS
	       - Procmail and lockfile now inherit any ignore status of most
		 regular signals (fixes a problem with some buggy shells)
	       - Optionally reads in a global rcfile (/etc/procmailrc)
		 before doing regular delivery (which includes the new
		 keyword: DROPPRIVS)
	       - Can pipe the mail to stdout on request
	       - Moved the "Reiterating kernel lock" diagnostic into the
		 "extended" (i.e. VERBOSE=on) section
	       - Tightened the loop when skipping comments in rcfiles (for
		 a slight speedup)
	       - Added support for filesystems not capable of creating
		 hardlinks
	       - Tightened the security check on initial absolute rcfiles
		 (they sometimes can't be world writable)
	       - Weighted scoring on conditions
	       - Ability to inline parse ${var-text} and ${var:-text}
	       - Ability to inline parse ${var+text} and ${var:+text}
	       - Skipping spaces after "!" and "$" on condition lines
	       - Implicit delivery somehow got broken: fixed
	       - Default umask is always 077 now for deliverymode
	       - Extended ^FROM_DAEMON and ^FROM_MAILER macro regexps again
	       - The -f option became less strict, everyone can use it now,
		 except that unpriviliged users will get an additional >From_
		 they didn't bargain for (in order to make fakes identifiable)
	       - The date on the From_ line can now be refreshed with -f-
	       - Introduced new recipe flags: E and e (else and error)
	       - Nested blocks clone procmail on a 'c' flag
	       - Introduced the EXITCODE special variable
	       - Implicit delivery mode is now entered if argv[0] doesn't start
		 with the word `procmail'
	       - Fixed the BSD support for kernel-locking only operation
	       - Taught the regexp engine about \< and \>
	       - Fixed bug present on some systems; caused the body to be
		 munged when filtering headers only
	       - Added -o option (makes procmail override the From_ lines, like
		 it used to)
	       - -p and -m together shrink the set of preset variables to the
		 bare minimum
	       - -p is not supported alongside -d anymore
	       - /etc/procmailrcs/ is the place for optional privileged
		 rcfiles in -m mailfilter mode
	       - Switched the meanings of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
	       - The 'a' flag didn't work correctly after filter recipes
	       - Changed the permissions on the lockfile, writing zero in it
	       - Check the permissions on the existing system mailbox, correct
		 them if necessary
	       - Clean up zombies more often
	    Changes to formail:
	       - Fixed a sender-determination-weight problem, it mixed up
		 the weights when autoreplying and when regenerating the From_
		 line (and thus didn't always pick the optimal field)
	       - Pays attention to the exitcode of the programs it started
	       - Accepts simultaneous -X and -k options
	       - Fixed a bug introduced in v2.82 in formail when using
		 the -x and the -k options simultaneously
	       - Rearranged the weights for "-rt" (made From: more important)
	       - Parsed return-addresses starting with a \ incorrectly
		 (causing it to coredump on occasion)
	       - Supports the -s option withouth a program argument
	       - Recognise extra UUCP >From_ lines
	       - Introduced the -B option to split up BABYL rmail files
	       - It regards and generates a FILENO variable (for easy
		 numbering)
	       - Moved the idcheck functionality into formail -D (due to
		 popular demand), for eliminating duplicate mails
	       - It terminates early now if it only needs the header
	       - The -n option can now sustain itself by reaping children
		 if it can't fork() immediately
	       - It supports incomplete field specifications which match
		 any field starting similarly
	       - Introduced the -u and -U options
	       - -a Message-ID: and -a Resent-Message-ID: to make it generate
		 new ones
	       - Keep the X-Loop: field when generating autoreplies
	       - Lowered the negative weight for .UUCP reply addresses
	       - Honour Content-Length: fields, also speeds up processing of
		 lengthy messages
	       - Clean up zombies more often
	       - Handle bangpath reconstruction
	       - Made -q the default, use -q- to disable
	    Miscellaneous changes:
	       - Detecting and dodging buggy zshs everywhere
	       - Slightly adjusted autoconf for the new non-standard 386BSD
		 and NeXTStep 3.1 environments
	       - Extended the FAQ
	       - Extended and fixed the procmailex man page
	       - Updated the crontab script recommendation in the procmail
		 man page
	       - Fixed the "procmail"-mailer definition in the procmail man
		 page
	       - Created a new procmailsc man page
	       - Fixed a bug in lockfile, the exitcode was not correct if
		 you used -! with more than one file
	       - Including <limits.h> now, some (old) architectures seem to
		 insist on this
	       - Revamped the library search code
	       - Provided a faster (than most libraries) strstr() routine
	       - Created the setid program (to be used by the SmartList
		 installation)
	       - Checking for fstat() in autoconf
	       - Avoiding i/o-redirection on subshells
	       - Provided for the ability to hotwire the lockingtests
	       - Autoconf asks if you'd like to use the existing autoconf.h
	       - Autoconf determines MAX_argc (for choplist)
1994/06/14: v3.01
	    No changes, version number bump to keep in sync with SmartList
1994/06/16: v3.02
	    Made formail quiet (by default) about Content-Length mismatches
	    The version number in patchlevel.h for this version was incorrect
	       and still displayed v3.01 (yes, silly, I know)
1994/06/30: v3.03
	    Limit the no. of retries on lockfiles if the recipient is over
	       quota (procmail & lockfile)
	    Removed some superfluous "procmail:" prefixes in the middle of
	       an error message
	    Utilise a syslog daemon (if present) to log some critical errors
	       (mostly attempted security violations and errors which are
	       fatal but can't occur (like an unwritable /dev/null))
	    Reconstruct and respect Content-Length: in procmail
	       (if you need the >From lines, you'll have to take any existing
	       Content-Lenght: field out of the header)
	    Reformatted the source code to match the changed conventions
	    Procmail always defaulting the umask to 077 for deliverymode broke
	       some systems, reverting back to the old method of allowing group
	       access on the system mailbox if necessary
