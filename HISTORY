1991/10/18: v2.30
	    Implemented a custom regular expression library (fully egrep
	       compatible), should eliminate the annoyances with incompatible
	       egreps
	    Accomplished the doubtful milestone of having a source file
	       (regexp.c) which provokes a compiler error on an old compiler
	       (if using the optimiser)
	    Ignoring leading spaces on condition lines now (means that
	       everything can be indented in the rcfile)
1991/10/22: v2.31
1991/12/05: v2.40
	    Made procmail capable of healing the recipient's mail spool file
	    Tricked NFS into supplying an access_time<modification_time for the
	       folders written
1991/12/13: v2.50
1992/01/22: v2.60
1992/01/31: v2.61
1992/04/30: v2.70
	    Made procmail & lockfile clock skew independent (important during
	       LOCKTIMEOUT)
	    Made procmail accept multiple recipients (this was not as trivial
	       as it sounds!), in order for complete compatibility with mailers
	       like smail 2.x
	    Expanded the mail-delivery-agent instructions in examples/advanced,
	       this includes specific intstructions for smail 2.x
	    Made special entries in config.h for semi-permanent environment-
	       variable overrides
	    Made formail more intelligent, it can now parse full-fledged
	       RFC822 addresses (quoting et al)
	    A complete rewrite of formail, the code got bigger, the runtime
	       requirement got bigger, it got slower, but, it's more structured
	       (so much for structured programming :-)
	    Made procmail check the permissions of its invoker, generate
	       an overriding From_ line if necessary, and consequently made it
	       accept the -f option (fromwhom), and also the alternate obsolete
	       -r option of course
	    Wiped out the ./include tree, made autoconf check it instead (the
	       compile line looks so terribly clean now :-)
	    Procmail makes an additional security check on the rcfiles before
	       accepting them (owner and permissions, see man page)
1992/07/01: v2.71
	    Sharpened the autoconf "const" check, to catch buggy AIX compilers
	    Made the MAILBOX_SEPARATORS more orthogonal (i.e. you can define
	       one or both now)
	    Added the -A option to formail, the only option that was missing
	       (to be able to boldly add header fields)
	    Fixed some typos and extended the procmailex man page by a popular
	       example
	    Enhanced the MH directory delivery mode, procmail uses the MH
	       method of finding the next number now (this requires procmail
	       to read the directory)
	    Fixed a typo in the WIFEXITED substitute macro (for non-POSIX
	       systems), should fix all erroneous "program failed" messages
	    Fixed a problem on byte-aligned machines with the 'i' flag
	    Now throwing away all environment variables starting with LD_
	       (not just LD_LIBRARY_PATH), but only on those machines that
	       have the security hole (i.e. SunOS)
	    Created logfile summariser (in shell-script form), by popular
	       demand (examples/mailstat)
	    Gave procmail, formail, lockfile and mailstat a more verbose
	       command line help (called up by -h or -?)
1993/02/04: v2.80
	    Started using CVS to manage the source (god's gift to programmers)
	    In procmail, lockfile and formail I built in a sanity check now,
	       in case they would be called with argc==0
	    Provided an *extensive* generic mailinglist example (well, it's
	       more than an example really :-)
	    Created the mailinglist swiss-army-knife utility "multigram"
	    Extended the man pages (including more examples)
	    Substantially changed the examples/advanced mailer integration
	       instructions (especially for smail)
	    Provided for brain damaged compilers that misparse #include lines
	    Enhanced lockfile a lot:
	       - the -r option really specifies *re*tries now
	       - concatenated and/or seperate options are allowed now
	       - fixed an inconsistency with removing lockfiles by force
	       - lockfile is more intelligent about locks which are impossible
		 to acquire (it sees it now and displays an appropriate error
		 message)
	       - related to this, lockfile now can return a whole range of
		 standard exitcodes to describe the error
	       - dropped the suid support for lockfile, sgid support however
		 was consolidated (with more descriptive error messages)
	    Changes to formail:
	       - formail does *NOT* CONCATENATE continued header-fields by
		 default now anymore, specify the -c option for this
	       - fixed the sender-determination-code, v2.71 didn't comply
		 with RFC-822 on some points
	       - the sender-determination-code now minimises the mailaddress
	       - taught formail about some more headers, previously formail
		 would refuse to split some mail-articles because it didn't
		 recognise the second field
	       - made it strip the <> on generated mail addresses
	       - reorganised the known header-fields into the header.h file
		 (to allow convenient additions)
	       - introduced the -l option, for generating procmail-alike
		 summaries
	       - introduced the -R option for renaming header-fields
	       - taught it about the Resent- fields when looking for a reply
		 address
	       - made sure that it does not generate an extra empty line at
		 the end of a mail with no body
	       - fixed the '-nnn' option, somehow this got broken
	       - added the -X option for extracting complete fields (to make
		 the toolset complete)
	       - defined away one const, for buggy Convex "ANSI" C compilers
	    Changes to procmail:
	       - procmail does *NOT* CONCATENATE continued header-fields
		 anymore, filter through "formail -c" for this
	       - procmail only escapes bogus From_ lines now when writing a
		 regular mailfolder (otherwise it's unchanged)
	       - changed the method for turning on extended diagnostics, the
		 preceding colon is not supported anymore, use VERBOSE=on
	       - worked over the mailbox-healing code, some changes were
		 needed to ensure complete functionality when the system
		 mailbox is in the user's home directory
	       - taught procmail about $? (see sh(1))
	       - added the INCLUDERC keyword, to permit unlimited nesting
		 of included rcfiles
	       - any program started in backquotes by procmail now has the
		 complete mail on its stdin
	       - all diagnostics logged by procmail will now be preceded by
		 a "procmail: " for easy identification
	       - as long as no LOGFILE has been specified, all diagnostics
		 will be mailed back to the sender (instead of /dev/null)
	       - when a program is specified on an action line, you can
		 precede the line by an environment variable name and an
		 equal sign;  this will read in the (unlimited length) text
		 from stdout into this variable
	       - backslash-newline pairs on continued program-action lines
		 will be simply passed on now;	unless the backslash-newline
		 pair is on an otherwise empty line, in which case only the
		 newline remains
	       - comsat/biff is fully supported now
	       - added the TRAP keyword, to allow for temporary file cleanup
	       - in explicit delivery mode, unknown users are now rejected
	       - system mailboxes with their suid or sgid bits set will not
		 be delivered to anymore, they are presumed to contain SysV
		 autoforwarding information
	       - a condition line of a recipe can now start with '?' in order
		 to use the exitcode of a program as true or false
	       - the ^TO and ^FROM_DAEMON special keywords can now be used
		 anywhere in the regular expression (^TO has been extended
		 as well)
	       - taught the ^^ special token to the internal egrep
	       - more than doubled the speed of the builtin regexp library
		 (which was already fast :-)
	       - procmail uses and defines LOGNAME instead of USER
	    Changes to the installation scripts:
	       - preset values for $(MAKE), $(CC) and $(SHELL) are respected
		 in Makefiles now
	       - a POSIX conforming grep is recognised and used
	       - the need for any -D_POSIX_SOURCE is recognised automatically
	       - to make sure that all this is possible, the Makefiles are
		 created in a two step-process now (make init)
	       - missing libraries for network/socket and opendir support
		 are searched for (you won't believe what names people picked
		 for network support libraries, not in your wildest dreams :-)
	       - the autoconf script now performs a reliability test on kernel
		 locking support
	       - also, network support for comsat tries to build up a compile
		 time cache for trivial get*byname() calls
