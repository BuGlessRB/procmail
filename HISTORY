1991/10/02: v2.20 (never released)
1991/10/18: v2.30
	    Reached the doubtful milestone of having a source file (regexp.c)
	       which provokes a compiler error on an old compiler
	       (if using the optimiser)
1991/10/22: v2.31

1991/12/13: v2.50
1992/01/22: v2.60
1992/01/31: v2.61
1992/04/30: v2.70
1992/07/01: v2.71
	    Gave procmail, formail, lockfile and mailstat a more verbose
	       command line help (called up by -h or -?)
1993/02/04: v2.80
	    Started using CVS to manage the source (god's gift to programmers)
	    Changes to formail:
	       - formail does *NOT* CONCATENATE continued header-fields by
		 default now anymore, specify the -c option for this
	       - fixed the sender-determination-code, v2.71 didn't comply
		 with RFC-822 on some points
	       - the sender-determination-code now minimises the mailaddress
	       - made it strip the <> on generated mail addresses
	       - reorganised the known header-fields into the header.h file
		 (to allow convenient additions)
	    Changes to procmail:
	       - procmail does *NOT* CONCATENATE continued header-fields
		 anymore, filter through "formail -c" for this
	       - procmail only escapes bogus From_ lines now when writing a
		 regular mailfolder (otherwise it's unchanged)
	       - changed the method for turning on extended diagnostics, the
		 preceding colon is not supported anymore, use VERBOSE=on
	       - comsat/biff is fully supported now
	       - system mailboxes with their suid or sgid bits set will not
		 be delivered to anymore, they are presumed to contain SysV
		 autoforwarding information
	       - taught the ^^ special token to the internal egrep
	    Changes to the installation scripts:
	       - missing libraries for network/socket and opendir support
		 are searched for (you won't believe what names people picked
		 for network support libraries, not in your wildest dreams :-)
	       - the autoconf script now performs a reliability test on kernel
		 locking support
	       - reached the doubtful milestone of consistently crashing the
		 kernel on a Convex by running the locktst program
1993/02/19: v2.81
	    Loosened the formats accepted for (un)subscription requests (some
	       got rejected, but were valid)
	    Redirected archive requests away from the regular list address
	    Sharpened the FROM_MAIL_DAEMON detection
	    Sped up multigram on duplicate names (also eliminates duplicates
	       in the best-matches list)
	    The locking tests in the autoconf scripts seemed to hang on
	       certain machines, I think I fixed that now
	    Procmail now uses saved-gids if available (allows for system-
	       mailbox locking from within an rcfile on systems that did not
	       have world-writeable /usr/mail directories)
	    Added a paragraph to the mailinglist/Manual (explaining multigram
	       and threshold values)
1993/06/02: v2.82 (never really released, was only available as prerelease 4)
	    Fixed sleeptime argument to lockfile
	    Refined the ^FROM_DAEMON macro again
	    Added a ^FROM_MAILER macro
	    Fixed the library conflict with openlog
	    Removed the dependencies on the structure of /usr/include
	    Removed the dependencies on the structure of /lib, /usr/lib etc.
	    Enhanced autoconf to ask for LOCKINGTEST directories
	    Added an extra paragraph to INSTALL explaining the necessity of
	       the LOCKINGTESTs
	    Made the internal egrep in procmail warn about mismatching parens
	       in a regexp
	    Made the regexp lib faster again (worst case performance improved)
	    Split up the manpage auto-generated sed scripts, some seds cannot
	       process scripts with more than 100 commands
	    Changed manpage substitions tokens to use @*@ instead of +*+
	    Added example recipe for emacs users in the procmailex man page
	    Extended recommend.c, it advises changing the permissions on
	       the system mail spool directory as well now (if needed)
	    Procmail can now deliver to multiple directories (using hardlinks)
	    If the umask permits o+x, this bit will be set on any mailbox
	       procmail delivers to directly
	    Added the LASTFOLDER & LOGABSTRACT variables to procmail in order
	       to ease the generation of custom logfile abstracts/summaries
	    Programs started from within TRAP can read the mail from stdin
	    Worked my way around the !@#$%^&*() POSIX setgid() semantics (if
	       your OS supports setrgid() or setregid())
	    Using off_t now (I seem to have overlooked it in my POSIX docs)
	    Eliminated all uses of "expr match"
	    Altered mailstat to work on really broken shells
	    Extended the FAQ
	    Changes to the mailinglist scripts:
	       - Finetuned some scripts
	       - Added digested lists
	       - Added standalone archive servers
	       - Extended logging for administrivia requests
	       - Flist can and should be setuid root now, POSIX setuid
		 semantics require it <sigh>
	       - Added support for multiple architectures
	       - Updated and extended the Manual file (reading recommended)
	       - Added the showlink convenience utility
	       - Added support for non-sendmail compatible mailers
1993/07/01: v2.90
	    Condition lines in recipes can now be started with a leading `*',
	       there is no longer a need to count condition lines, simply
	       set the number to zero, and let procmail find out by itself
	    Added the -a and -m options to procmail, for enhanced interfacing
	       to sendmail
	    Updated the recommended sendmail.cf mailer entry docs in
	       examples/advanced
	    Fixed a race condition when the recipient mailbox did not exist
	       and two procmails simultaneously tried to create it
	    Cleaned up main() in procmail.c (localised variables)
	    When procmail gobbles up the leading From_ line, it reads in 2KB
	       blocks now (instead of character wise; saves a few system calls)
1993/07/02: v2.91
	    Fixed a race condition in autoconf that caused problems on machines
	       that didn't have memmove(3) and were too fast (make got confused
	       about the modification time of an object file)
	    Corrected the SHELL=/bin/shell assignment in mailinglist/install.sh
	    Made the mailinglist/install.sh script check if procmail was
	       compiled without "#define console"
	    Fixed a typo in the regex library (introduced in v2.82pre4),
	       caused some valid matches not to be found if the regular
	       expression starts with an epsilon transition
	    Fixed a few typos in the man pages
	    Made sure the logfile was flushed before procmail exits
	    Forgot to redirect output of a test in autoconf to /dev/null
	    Stripping off leading "From " lines now before passing mails
	       through the mailinglist
	    Reached the doubtful milestone to sometimes crash an Ultrix
	       machine (due to the lockingtests, not procmail itself)
1993/10/22: v2.92
	    Fixed a formail sender-determination-weight problem, it mixed up
	       the weights when autoreplying and when regenerating the From_
	       line (and thus didn't always pick the optimal field)
	    Detecting and dodging buggy zshs everywhere
	    Procmail was still occasionally trying to lock /dev/null, which
	       is of course silly, fixed that
	    Taught procmail about `nesting recipes'; they allow parts of
	       an rcfile to be grouped hierarchically
	    Fixed a discrepancy between /bin/sh backquote expansion in
	       environment assignments and procmail (preserving all spaces)
	    Procmail logs its pid and the time when verbose logging is turned
	       on
	    Slightly adjusted autoconf for the new non-standard 386BSD and
	       NeXTStep 3.1 environments
	    Moved the "Reiterating kernel lock" diagnostic into the "extended"
	       (i.e. VERBOSE=on) section
	    Procmail will be logging timestamps in the logfile when VERBOSE=on
	    Caused the regular TIMEOUT to break a `hanging' kernel lock
	    SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 can be used to turn on and off verbose logging
	    Extended and fixed the procmailex man page
	    Tightened the loop when skipping comments in rcfiles
	    Updated the crontab script recommendation in the procmail man page
	    Fixed the "procmail"-mailer definition in the procmail man page
	    Worked around a bug in the `ANSI'-compiler of Domain/OS
	    Made formail pay attention to the exitcode of the programs it
	       started
	    Formail mistakenly didn't accept both -X and -k options
	    Fixed a bug introduced in v2.82 in formail when using both
	       the -x and the -k options
	    Procmail and lockfile now inherit any ignore status of most
	       regular signals (fixes a problem with some buggy shells)
	    Added support for filesystems not capable of creating hardlinks
	    Procmail optionally reads in a global rcfile (/etc/procmailrc)
	       before doing regular delivery
	    Procmail can pipe the mail to stdout on request
	    Rearranged the weights for "formail -rt" (made From: more
	       important)
	    Changes to the mailinglist package:
	       Cleaned up install.sh* for the mailinglists: starting su with
		  commands on stdin, checking some permissions now in the
		  filesystem to prevent silly mistakes during the installation
	       v2.91 archive server logged into the wrong file (../log), fixed
	       Made the x_command script list the nearest match when adding
		  or removing people from a list
	       New x_command directive: checkdist
	       New convenience command: donatelist
	       Fixed a few typos that slipped into procbounce and flush_digests
	       Explicit support for moderated lists
	       Eliminating duplicate submissions
	       Catering for autoreplies to people not on the accept list
	       Flush_digests can now be forced to push out digests
	       Clipped an a bit too greedy -request-redirection-regexp in
		  rc.submit
	       Tuned the procbounce script (it does what I mean now
		  and it got more verbose in its diagnostics)
	       Changes to the arch_retrieve script:
		  - allow the archive directory to be a symbolic link itself
		  - friendlier help command
		  - allow searching for regexps
		  - protect the user against all too eager wildcards
		  - fixed the ls command (one mail back per command)
	       Carbon copies of subscription requests contained misleading
		  diagnostics
