# Notice the double : in the next recipe, this will cause a lockfile
# named "$MAILDIR/todd.lock" to be used if and only if this mail is going
# into the file "todd".

:0:				# Anything from thf
* ^From.*thf@somewhere.someplace
todd				# will go to $MAILDIR/todd


# The next recipe will likewise use $MAILDIR/uunetbox.lock as a lock file.

:0:				# Anything from people at uunet
* ^From.*@uunet
uunetbox			# will go to $MAILDIR/uunetbox


# And here the lockfile will be $MAILDIR/henries.lock of course.

:0:				# Anything from Henry
* ^From.*henry
henries				# will go to $MAILDIR/henries


# But you can specify any lockfile you want, like "myfile".  The following
# recipe will use "$MAILDIR/myfile" as the lock file.

:0:myfile			# All 'questions' will go to
* ^Subject:.*questions
toread				# $MAILDIR/toread

# Anything that has not been delivered by now will go to $DEFAULT

# After procmail sees the end of the rcfile, it pretends that it sees a
# LOCKFILE=$DEFAULT$LOCKEXT
# Therefore $DEFAULT is always locked.
